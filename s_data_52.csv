Data for the number of deaths was obtained from the public Painel Coronav√≠rus dataset (available at \url{https://github.com/mquartin/covid19-ifr-br}; accessed on April 28, 2021).  The date of death in Painel Coronav√≠rus dataset is not the actual time of death but rather the time of notification.  For this reason we considered the number of deaths for a given date as the number of deaths recorded in the  Painel Coronav√≠rus dataset following the analysis of \citet{marra2020bayesian}",9,,15300,,,,,,
